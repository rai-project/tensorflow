description: >
  Squeezenet achieves similar results to AlexNet, at 50x fewer parameters and 1/500th the size.
  Small models are more feasible to deploy on hardware with limited memory, require less
  communication during distributed training, and are easier to distribute to clients.
  SqueezeNet achieves 57.5% and 80.3% top-1 and top-5 acuracty on ImageNet.
