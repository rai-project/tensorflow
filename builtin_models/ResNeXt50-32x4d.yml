description: >
  ResNeXt is a simple, highly modularized network architecture for image classification. Our network is constructed by repeating
  a building block that aggregates a set of transformations with the same topology. Our simple design results in a homogeneous,
  multi-branch architecture that has only a few hyper-parameters to set. This strategy exposes a new dimension, which we call
  “cardinality” (the size of the set of transformations), as an essential factor in addition to the dimensions of depth and width.
